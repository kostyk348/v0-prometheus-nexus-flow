## Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Define proper types and interfaces
- Avoid `any` type when possible
- Use meaningful variable names

### React
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Use proper prop types
- Implement error boundaries for critical components

### CSS/Tailwind
- Use Tailwind utility classes
- Follow the design token system in globals.css
- Ensure responsive design (mobile-first)
- Test in multiple browsers

### File Organization
- Place components in `components/`
- Place utilities in `lib/`
- Place types in `lib/types/`
- Keep files focused on single responsibility

## Testing

Before submitting a PR:
1. Test your changes locally
2. Verify on multiple browsers
3. Check mobile responsiveness
4. Ensure no TypeScript errors: `npm run build`
5. Test with different URLs and content types
